- **Round results:**

## 7. Challenges (Double, Re-Double, Full Set, Single Hand)
- Any player from any team may issue a challenge.

### Double
- Opponents challenge the bidder team.  
- If bidder team wins → +2 points.  
- If bidder team loses → -2 points.  

### Re-Double
- Bidder team re-challenges after a Double.  
- If bidder team wins → +4 points.  
- If bidder team loses → -4 points.  

### Full Set
- Opponents re-challenge after a Re-Double.  
- If bidder team wins → +6 points.  
- If bidder team loses → -6 points.  

### Single Hand
- A player declares they will attempt to win alone.  
- **Scoring:**  
  - If the player wins → **+3 points**.  
  - If the player loses → **-3 points**.  
- **Dealer rule:** Whoever wins the Single Hand (or beats it) becomes the **next dealer**.  
- **Eligibility conditions:**  
  - A Single Hand can only be declared if the player’s hand is **beatable**.  
  - Example: If a player holds J, 9, A, 10 of the same suit, they cannot be beaten in that suit — so they must also hold at least one smaller card (maximum a 9) from another suit, which could be beaten by a J of that suit.  
  - If a player holds J, 9, A/10 from two suits and **no other cards from any other suit**, the Single Hand does **not** count, since it is unbeatable.

  - Holding both **King and Queen of trump** = “Marriage.”  
  - If bidder’s team has it → +4 points toward their target.
