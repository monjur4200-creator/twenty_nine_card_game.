- The **highest bidder** sets the target score for their team.
- **No tie at bid** — bidding continues until one player wins.

---

## 4. Trump
- The winning bidder chooses the **trump suit**.
- **Blind Trump:**  
  - Trump is kept secret until a player cannot follow the lead suit.  
  - At that moment, the player may choose to reveal the trump or continue without revealing.  
- **7th Card Trump:**  
  - A player may declare trump based on their 7th card.  
  - They must check one of their last 4 cards (a middle card).  
  - If they also hold a point card of that trump in their other seven cards, they may choose to play or not play.  

---

## 5. Trick-taking
- Play proceeds clockwise.
- **Rules of play:**
  - Must follow suit if possible.
  - If unable, may play trump or discard.
  - Highest trump wins the trick; if no trump is played, highest card of the lead suit wins.
- Trick winner leads the next round.

---

## 6. Scoring System
- The bidder team’s success depends on **+6 points margin**:
  - They must either finish with **+6 points advantage** over opponents, or  
  - Ensure opponents fall to **-6 points**.  
- **Round results:**
  - Winning team = **+1 point**.  
  - Losing team = **-1 point**.  
- If the same team remains the bidder team in the next round, they again receive **+1 or -1** depending on outcome.  
- **No sudden death.**  
- If the bidder’s team wins all 8 tricks, they gain **+2 points**.  

---

## 7. Challenges (Double, Re-Double, Full Set, Single Hand)
- Any player from any team may issue a challenge.

### Double
- Opponents challenge the bidder team.  
- If bidder team wins → +2 points.  
- If bidder team loses → -2 points.  

### Re-Double
- Bidder team re-challenges after a Double.  
- If bidder team wins → +4 points.  
- If bidder team loses → -4 points.  

### Full Set
- Opponents re-challenge after a Re-Double.  
- If bidder team wins → +6 points.  
- If bidder team loses → -6 points.  

### Single Hand
- A player declares they will attempt to win alone.  
- **Scoring:**  
  - If the player wins → **+3 points**.  
  - If the player loses → **-3 points**.  
- **Dealer rule:** Whoever wins the Single Hand (or beats it) becomes the **next dealer**.  
- **Eligibility conditions:**  
  - A Single Hand can only be declared if the player’s hand is **beatable**.  
  - Example: If a player holds J, 9, A, 10 of the same suit, they cannot be beaten in that suit — so they must also hold at least one smaller card (maximum a 9) from another suit, which could be beaten by a J of that suit.  
  - If a player holds J, 9, A/10 from two suits and **no other cards from any other suit**, the Single Hand does **not** count, since it is unbeatable.  

---

## 8. Special Rules
- **Marriage:**  
  - Holding both **King and Queen of trump** = “Marriage.”  
  - If bidder’s team has it → +4 points toward their target.  
  - If opponents have it → -4 points for bidder’s team.  
  - Marriage can only be declared **after trump is revealed** and both cards are intact.  

---

## 9. Redeal Conditions
A redeal occurs if:
- A player is dealt **all 4 Jacks**.  
- A player has **no point cards** in hand.  
- In **7th card trump**, if no point card of trump exists in the other seven cards.  
- Both players of a team receive **no trump cards**.  
- If no one bids except the dealer.  

---

## 10. Rule Enforcement & Penalties
- **No signaling** between partners is allowed.  
- If a player disobeys rules:
  - First = **warning**.  
  - If repeated = **penalty**:  
    - If on bidder’s team → **-1 point** to their team, round ends, new round begins.  
    - If on opponent’s team → **+1 point** to bidder’s team, round ends, new round begins.

   - A plays A♦, B plays Q♦, C plays 8♦.  
   - A wins with A♦.  

5. **Trick 5:**  
   - A leads with 7♥ (reveals trump).  
   - B plays J♥, C plays 9♥, D plays K♥.  
   - B wins with J♥ (trump).

### Scoring
- **Team A & C (bidders):**  
  - J♠ (3), A♠ (1), A♦ (1), 9♦ (2), J♣ (3), A♣ (1)  
  - **Total = 11 points**

- **Team B & D (opponents):**  
  - J♦ (3), 10♠ (1), J♥ (3), A♥ (1), 9♣ (2)  
  - **Total = 10 points**

- **Grand Total = 21 points** (the other 7 points are in non‑scoring cards like K, Q, 8, 7).

- The bid was **19**.  
- The bidder’s team (A & C) scored only **11 points**, which is far below their target.  
- Therefore, they **fail the bid**.

### Result
- Opponents (B & D) win the round.  
- **Scoring outcome:**  
  - Team B & D = **+1**  
  - Team A & C = **-1**
